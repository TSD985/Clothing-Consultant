### Clothing Consultant – RPA Weather-Based Suggestion Bot

This project is an RPA-powered bot that provides personalized clothing suggestions based on real-time weather data. It uses browser automation to fetch the current temperature and conditions for a user-specified city and suggests appropriate clothing options accordingly.

### How It Works

1. **City Input**  
   - The bot asks the user to enter a city name to check the weather.
2. **Weather Retrieval**  
   - It opens a weather website and scrapes real-time temperature (in °C) and weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy).
3. **Clothing Recommendation Logic**  
   - Based on the weather, the bot provides recommendations:
     - **Hot (30°C and above):** Light clothes like t-shirts and shorts
     - **Cold (Below 15°C):** Jackets, sweaters, scarves
     - **Rainy:** Umbrella, raincoat, waterproof shoes
     - **Normal (15°C - 30°C):** Comfortable daily wear
